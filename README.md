# GameOfLife

Hello, and welcome to Jared's Game of Life. Thanks for taking a look. In the following I will break down the process of creating this game in beautiful, beautiful JavaScript. So, come along, the journey starts NOW!


Starting:
  1. I create a repository on github.
  2. I then make the directory locally and link it to the new repo in the command terminal.
  3. Then I make the file GameOfLife.js.
  4. Also an HTML file so we can actually see what happens... that's good right?

The rules (as said by https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/conway):
  1. Game of life takes place on a 2D grid. Each cell in the grid will be in one of the two possible states:
      ALIVE(green cells) or DEAD(black cells)

  2. A cell switches from DEAD to ALIVE if its surrounded exactly by 3 living cells.
  3. A cell remains alive if its surrounded by 2 or 3 living cells.
  4. A cell switches from being ALIVE to DEAD if its surrounded by more than 3 living cells because of over population.
  5. A cell switches from being ALIVE to DEAD if its surrounded by less than 2 cells because of under population.

With that all said, go ahead and clone my repo and open up  GameOfLife.html file to take a look!
